                <!-- User Interview -->
                <h4 class = "text-secondary"> User Interviews </h4>
                <p class = "text-secondary mb-0"> We conducted 3 interviews with 3 Wellesley professors.</p>
                <br>
                <p> <b> Interviewee 1 </b></p>

                <p>
                    Interviewee #1 is a professor from the CS department currently teaching fully remotely and living near the Wellesley area. His biggest concerns are the lack of normal human communication and interaction, and not being able to connect with students on a personal level as he had before the pandemic. In response to questions about how the pandemic and teaching remotely has impacted his physical/mental health, he says “humans are social animals, more than we think, you cannot take this away from them and expect that they would be fine”.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than concerns about feeling overwhelmed by feelings of isolation, Interviewee #1 finds that the lack of physical separation between his workplace and his home makes it harder to have a work-life balance. He feels that he is “always available, always checking [his] email/Piazza when [he] is not doing something else”. It, therefore, seems that the app we design should not be one that connects students with professors for educational purposes, but more for casual entertainment. However, Interviewee #1 also notes that he has gained more time during the day because he doesn’t have to commute to college, and can just finish his lectures, meetings, and office hours by turning off the camera. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Interviewee has also learned and adopted new technologies for online teaching, some of which he appreciates and others he found frustrating to use. Patch is an app that helps create direct appointments: professors list out their availabilities during the week and students can request office hours. Interviewee #1 struggled with this app and “stopped using it because it became too overwhelming to use”. One problem that Interviewee #1 identified with the app is that users are not notified if an appointment is made for the next five minutes, which means that users would have to continuously make sure that the user has not missed any meetings. Another problem is that the app is very static -- the availability of a user throughout a certain week remains the same for every week (ex. Wednesdays 9 AM - 12 PM)  - it is unlike a message or a phone call where users can instantly notify others of changes in availabilities for a certain week. Interviewee #1 resorted back to scheduling office hours via email and sending a Google invite. Despite his struggles with Patch, Interviewee #1 enjoys his experience with Piazza and is still using this platform this term. Piazza is a platform that allows students to post questions and professors to answer them. It is very easy and intuitive to use. This platform also helps address some of the timezone issues where students can ask questions on Piazza instead of attending office hours at a time that does not suit them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interviewee #1 also feels positive emotions in addition to his concerns. He is happy that “online teaching can happen at this time and age, or else people around the world wouldn’t have a chance to take classes”. He is not overwhelmed by teaching remotely and by the term system, and hears positive feedback about his recorded pre-lecture videos which makes him happy. Although it is harder to connect on a more personal level with students, Interviewee #1 finds it easier to have 1:1 conversations with students during office hours, and the ability to see their faces up close on-screen helps him observe if students understand the concepts in class. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, it seems like Interviewee #1 has adapted his teaching style pretty well to remote teaching and the term system, and is not feeling overwhelmed by his work. However, as an outgoing person and someone who finds joy in interacting with people and having a connection with his students, the pandemic has overwhelmed him with feelings of isolation, and he desires deeply for more normal human communication and interaction. He looked especially lonely and saddened when talking about this topic. It seems that an app for entertainment that would connect members of the Wellesley community together would be great for Interviewee #1, one that would help him gain more human interaction with students and colleagues, but also does not have any educational purposes to take the pressure off of “being always available”.

                <br>

                <p> <b> Interviewee 2 </b></p>

                <p>
                    Interviewee 2 is a professor in the Neuroscience Department. They are teaching not only fully remote classes, but are located in California in the efforts to make some headway on their postdoc research, which was interrupted in March 2020. Interviewee is most concerned about getting to know students personally, and the wellbeing of students in different timezones. They are also concerned about balancing lecture time and group work/collaborative time in the term system schedule, emphasizing collaboration to give students the chance to know one another. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     When it comes to students from different time zones, a particularly concerning aspect of remote learning is that time zones interfere with due-date equality. As Interviewee 2 put it, “if my midnight is your five AM, you aren’t actually getting those five hours. At least I hope not.” Interviewee 2 uses Sakai to release assignments and for Problem Set submission, and has worked out a system to assign due dates based on time zone. At the moment, their policy is that students have until 11:59 PM in their local time zone to turn assignments in (all on the same local calendar date). Interviewee 2 hopes this eliminates some of the stress associated with being out of sync with Wellesley's time zone, and has even released all of the homework assignments at once to allow students to work on it whenever they can. That being said, all lectures are synchronous and students are expected to attend. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interviewee 2 feels their work-life balance is pretty good because they are only teaching one course, but being out of sync with both Wellesley and all international students makes holding office hours that work for everyone much more difficult, especially since they prefer to keep a regular schedule. While it is better for their work-life balance, Interviewee 2 is worried that students aren't reaching out about issues with due dates, attending lectures, or assignments as much as they need to. As they put it, they are "trying to make myself available, but [they] can't work on a solution if [they] don't know the problem even exists." Interviewee 2 also includes that trying to stay available to multiple time zones, even without meetings scheduled regularly with students from each time zone, is a challenge in itself. 
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Interviewee 2 says that ideally, they would have more class time to get to know students, but the term system requires them to spend most of class time lecturing, and they prefer to set time aside for students to interact with one another when lecture ends. Interviewee hopes that students are able to attend SI and tutoring hours, but misses meeting students in person and being able to not only talk about lecture material, but engage in casual conversation to get to know the students as individuals rather than just academically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it seems that Interviewee 2 is primarily concerned with accommodating students in different time zones, particularly international students, and forming the connections with students that they usually form during in-person, outside-class encounters.   
  
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                <p> <b> Interviewee 3 </b></p>
                <p>
                    Interviewee 3 is a professor from Wellesley’s Jewish Studies Department and is currently teaching remotely from his home near Boston. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, he demonstrates a relatively positive attitude towards his current life, in terms of both work and life. For remote teaching, he expressed a positive attitude towards Zoom classes after having taught an in person class with a mask on for a long time at Wellesley last semester. He believes that Zoom classes are more effective and he can build better connections with the students. Moreover, although he is not particularly struggling with the term system, he does believe that it has some major issues particularly for a “humanistic scholarship” which he teaches.  The tight schedule does not give students enough time to read and absorb materials. But once again, he personally is doing okay with his courses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second benefit that he mentioned is the adoption of using sign-up for office hours. Before the pandemic he told students to come in at a certain time. But through this pandemic, sign-up is actually a useful tool and he will continue to use it moving on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the classroom, remote teaching has a major benefit on his personal life. He no longer needs to spend a big chunk of his time on scheduling and ensuring that his kids will be picked up from school on time. His commitment is completely online right now and it has made his life easier. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to having the above benefits, he did not face many obstacles that some other professors might face in remote teaching either. For instance, he had not had students from different time zones needing accommodations and he has thus not thought about it much. 
                    Second, he did not have problems learning new technologies. He built course websites for remote learning, something that is time-consuming but not difficult at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only drawback that emerged from working from home is that he gets distracted by email notifications popped up on his phone from his personal life. He has been trying to improve this situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly and importantly, he mentions that it is the pandemic, not remote learning, that has brought him a difficult time. Like most people, he feels sad about what is going on in the world and about the things he can't do. He also doesn't like how he can no longer travel, something he used to do a lot. But they are both caused by the pandemic, not remote learning. This argument is distinctive to this interviewee and should be kept in mind in the development of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, Interviewee #3 is handling the current situation well as he said himself, “I am doing okay”. And learning from this individual case, the main pain point the app should focus on dealing with is the pandemic, not remote learning.  
                </p>
