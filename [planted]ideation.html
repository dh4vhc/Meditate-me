                <h4 class = "text-secondary"> Designs </h4>
                <p class = "text-secondary mb-0">Below, we detail the two proposed designs. In the end, we used most of the structure of Design 1, and incorporated the map feature from Design 2 into the Design 1 navigation. </p>
                <br>

                <h6>Design 1</h6>
                <img class="solution-img img-fluid mb-5" src="assets/img/design1.png" alt="Design 1">
                <p>
                    We tried to design a user interface to be as simple as possible by laying out all of the action items clearly on the homepage. The homepage of the app is the garden of the user’s home department, and they can proceed to the three main tasks by clicking on the three icons on the left. We labeled our icons to enhance memorability and used affordances and signifiers (ex. the arrow in each button) to enhance the learnability of our system. We also made our buttons fairly big -- users can click on the whole strip of “Community” or “Profile” instead of just on the icons -- to accommodate users with lower eye-sight or dexterity. Clicking on “Community” brings users to a list of departments and clicking on a department will bring the user to the garden of that specific department. Within each departmental garden is a News Feed on the top right corner, where users can send their own posts or view system generated notifications. User posts and system generated messages are separated into two sections, which will contrast with our second design. Users can also use the texting bar at the bottom of the screen to chat with other users in the same garden. Messages will be displayed on the top of the user’s avatar. Users can view other user’s profiles by going to the “Professors” section under “Community”. The Profile page clearly displays the user’s basic information, the classes the user is teaching or has archived, and the seeds the user has accumulated. Going back to the homepage and clicking on “Classes” will bring the user to a list of classes that the user is teaching. They can add new classes by clicking on the plus sign at the top right of the screen, or monitor the progress of a specific class by clicking into that class. The progress of a class is displayed as a plant at the bottom of the screen, and professors can use the left and right arrows to view how the class is doing for each lecture or chapter. There is a “Plant Class” button at the top left for users to plant this class into the department’s garden. Overall, we picked this design because of its simplicity, which aligns with our design guidelines of not wanting to design an app that is too complicated and will take away too much time from professors just to learn our app. However, we think that we can improve our design by creating elements that are more Wellesley specific to add a greater sense of community. <br><br>

                <br><p>This design aims to target Wellesley users by appealing to nostalgia for the campus. The home page ties in views around campus to remind users of the beautiful scenery and to evoke a sense of fondness and positive association. Similarly, the department navigation map ties in physical elements of campus in the form of academic buildings to divide the departments into separate and more manageable categories. Users are also given the option to search up departments by name, accommodating different user personalities where some might prefer the cuter and more engaging method and some might prefer a more direct way. Browsing the map would allow users to view department gardens or select professors from each department to view their profiles. Consistency in navigation is maintained through the "< Back" button and "HOME" button at the top. The updates feed separates automatically generated progress updates from short, customizable, tweet-like posts by professors through color coding. <br><br>

                <h4 class = "text-secondary"> Critique Takeaways </h4>
                <p>Our reviewers really enjoyed the plant metaphor and our target audience— many people seemed to agree that professors deserve an app catered to them, as well. Some reviewers were concerned that being able to view the plants of other professors may foster a sense of competition, and undercut the easygoing, calming, and recreational intentions of this app. In order to address this, we decided to eliminate the ability to see each professor’s plant progress, letting interaction and virtual socialization take place in department gardens, where plants could be displayed but not connected to any specific professors. Apart from this, the main critique we received during the review session was that the reasoning behind having department gardens was unclear. To address this issue, we decided to use a short onboarding process to explain the purpose and functions of the app, as well as creating an FAQ page to help users with any other concerns or confusions they may have. </p>
